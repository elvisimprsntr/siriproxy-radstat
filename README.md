SiriProxy-Thermostat
====================

About
-----

SiriProxy-Thermostat is a [SiriProxy] (https://github.com/plamoni/SiriProxy) plugin that uses the API of the [Radio Thermostat] (http://www.radiothermostat.com/) brand or re-branded WiFi enabled thermostats. It does not require a jailbreak, nor do I endorse doing so.  

First, you must have SiriProxy installed and working.  [HOW-TOs for Siriprixy] (https://github.com/plamoni/SiriProxy/wiki/Installation-How-Tos) 

Second, you must have at least one Radio Thermostat configured with a static IP address on your network.  

I have received offers to make a donation to help offset the cost of hardware and for my time.  If you feel so inclined you can donate thru PayPal.
