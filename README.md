siriproxy-radstat
====================

About
-----

Siriproxy-radstat is a [SiriProxy] (https://github.com/plamoni/SiriProxy) plugin that uses the API of the [Radio Thermostat] (http://www.radiothermostat.com/) brand and re-branded WiFi enabled thermostats. It does not require a jailbreak, nor do I endorse doing so.  

First, you must have SiriProxy installed and working.  [HOW-TOs for Siriprixy] (https://github.com/plamoni/SiriProxy/wiki/Installation-How-Tos) 

Second, you must have at least one Radio Thermostat configured with a static IP address on your network and updated with the latest firmware.      


Thermostats
-----------  

Before installing a Radio Thermoststat you will need to ensure compatibility with your HVAC system, or have one professionally installed.  These thermostats require either a C-Wire conection from your HVAC or an external 24VAC power supply for the WiFi USNAP module.  

The [Radio Thermostat Support] (http://www.radiothermostat.com/support.html) site has excellent information and instructional videos.  


The [Advanced Technical Information] (http://www.radiothermostat.com/latestnews.html#advanced) page provides access to Wi-Fi USNAP Module API document for thermostat models CT80, CT30, and 3M50.     

Radio Thermostat models CT22 and CT20 are not specifically mentioned in the API documentation, but it is possible those use the same or a similar API.  There are other brand names which are basically re-branded Radio Thermostat models, but there is no guarantee those thermostats use the same API.
