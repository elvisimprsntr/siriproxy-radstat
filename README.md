SiriProxy-Thermostat
====================

About
-----

SiriProxy-Thermostat is a [SiriProxy] (https://github.com/plamoni/SiriProxy) plugin that uses the API of the [Radio Thermostat] (http://www.radiothermostat.com/) brand or re-branded WiFi enabled thermostats. It does not require a jailbreak, nor do I endorse doing so.  

First, you must have SiriProxy installed and working.  [HOW-TOs for Siriprixy] (https://github.com/plamoni/SiriProxy/wiki/Installation-How-Tos) 

Second, you must have at least one Radio Thermostat configured with a static IP address on your network and updated with the latest firmware.    

I have received offers to make a donation to help offset the cost of hardware and for my time.  If you feel so inclined you can donate thru PayPal.  


Thermostats
-----------  

The [Advance Technical Information] (http://www.radiothermostat.com/latestnews.html#advanced) page provides access to Wi-Fi USNAP Module API document for thermostat models CT80, CT30, and 3M50.     

Radio Thermosts models CT22 and CT20 also have WiFi capability, but it is not known if those use the same API.
